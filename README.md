Hello!   
Here is a self-made website repository, showing plenty of groceries.  
Our HOME PAGE is at '/home.html', but it will also run if you tap <b>'/home'</b>.  
Apparently, the rule above is widely adapted to all pages here.  
Extremely thank you for your visiting, and wish you may have a fantastic day!
